FluMut is an open-source tool designed to search for molecular markers with potential impact on the biological characteristics of Influenza A viruses of the A(H5N1) subtype, starting from complete or partial nucleotide genome sequences.

A marker is defined as a set of amino acid mutations (one or more mutations located in the same or different proteins) for which a phenotypic effect has been demonstrated.
FluMut is based on a database containing a list of markers previously described in the literature as associated with:
- increased zoonotic potential
- increased virulence in different host categories
- increased/conferred resistance towards antiviral drugs

This database will be periodically updated with new described markers.

For each marker identified within the submitted sequences, the tool provides information on: 
- the position of the mutations composing the marker
- the effect of the marker as described in the literature
- the influenza subtype in which the marker was observed or tested
- the corresponding bibliographic references.

In addition, the tool generates an Excel workbook for a better visualisation of the results, as described in the [outputs section](docs/output#excel-output).

The FluMut functionality will be soon extended to all influenza A subtypes.
